    <h2>A Special Message for my Baby's Special Day</h2>
    <p>
      On your special day, I want to celebrate you—the man who has shown me so much of what love and strength truly mean. From the moment we met, I felt something so real between us, a bond that continues to grow even through the distance. I see all the ways you’ve been trying to become the best version of yourself, and I want you to know that I am so proud of you. Every step you take—whether it’s your own challenges, your work, your family, or the best, quiet moments when you’re vulnerable with me—shows me the depth of your heart and the man you are becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, I want to celebrate not just your birthday, but everything that makes you so incredibly special to me. From the very first time we met at that festival—locking eyes in the crowd and smiling—I knew there was something about you that I couldn’t ignore. Even though we didn’t get that New Year’s kiss, fate had other plans for us.
    </p>
    <p>
      It hasn’t been easy being apart, but not a day goes by where I don’t think of you and miss being by your side. I miss seeing your smile light up a room, the way you laugh, and how you look at me when you think no one’s watching. You may not always say how much you miss me, but I feel it in the little things you do—the texts, the calls, even when you just check in to see how I am. It means everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know how hard you’ve worked, not just for yourself but for us. There are moments when the world gets tough, and you feel like you’re not enough, but I see the opposite. I see a man who loves fiercely, who cares deeply even when he doesn’t say the words. I see a man who is brave enough to stand up for his loved ones, even when it’s difficult. And I love you for every bit of who you are, even the parts you try to hide away. I am here, always, with open arms, ready to love you completely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The promise of our future keeps me going, and I believe in us. No matter the distance or the challenges we face, I know we’ll come out stronger because we have something truly special. I can’t wait to celebrate more birthdays with you, to build our life together, and to make all the dreams we talk about a reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I still think back to our first proper date. I was so shy, I didn’t even know I felt such a way with you. Who knew we’d end up having a joint by a church and then watching Barbie together, laughing and cuddling through the night? Cutest dates ever. Those simple moments have meant the world to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came that little bit of the harder times, which we still handled like pros, like after your accident, when we found ourselves sharing hospital food and cuddling in that hospital bed we somehow made it fun. You were so strong and brave. Even in those tough moments, being with you made everything feel better like we could get through anything as long as we were together. And when we went home, it felt like we’d faced something big and came out stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every time we’re together, whether at festivals, playing games, or just curled up watching movies, you’ve brought so much joy into my life. Leaving at the airport was the hardest moment I’ve had, but I hold onto the belief that we’ll create even more memories, and that this is just a chapter in our story. You are my everything, and I thank the universe every day for bringing you into my life. I’m excited for all the moments we’ll create, and I am so proud of the man you are and the one you’re becoming. May God bless you and have an amazing year ahead as you deserve everything good that is coming your way. Here is to to many more birthday together, while we work towards our goals and enrich our lives. I love you 🎂🤍.
